## how to do it

This is my first time using c++, so i tried following the book, which said to use cmake. This just made a bunch of folders and files
after i made an empty cmakelist file, and then I didnt see any actual program to run.

Made using g++ (GCC) 15.2.1 20251112

`cd src`
`g++ main.cc -o rayray`
`./rayray >> ok.ppm`

Then look at the cool image in gimp or any other image viewer.
You can generate other image formats using SDL2, that may be added at the end.
