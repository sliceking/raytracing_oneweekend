## how to do it

This is my first time using c++, so i tried following the book, which said to use cmake. This just made a bunch of folders and files
after i made an empty cmakelist file, and then I didnt see any actual program to run.

g++ seems to get the job done for me. It may change in the following chapters, but we'll see.
